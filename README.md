### Description

The main purpose of that package is provide some HASH TABLE/Message Digest algorithms to help programmers to calculate digital signatures from strings. Here you can find string-optimized codes to calculate SHA-256, SHA-512 and SHA-1024. Included are non-optimized MD5 and SHA-1 source codes just to get a comparison with the other ones. You may just input any string to get the results (256, 512 or 1024 bits digest).They returns always a string of HEX numbers, representing the bytes of the digest. You may delete the HEX instruction to reach just the bytes themselves. MATH.DLL is included too.

Warning: due to several technical dificulties, the SHA-512 and 1024 versions are customized ones, not the official ones. BUT THEY REALLY WORK as message digest and are serious choice to any data integration routine!
